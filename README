This project try to implement a generic framework to easily manage cellular automata. Descriptions of such automata can be found on Wikipedia : 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton

The base of the framework (manage automata) is already done. Now we try to add optimizations, samples and other peripherical improvements. Of course 
this project is not in an open-source just because of fashion : if anybody want to add specific improvements, he/she is welcome ! {^_^}

If you have some ideas but do not want or cannot develop it by yourself, you can also create an issue. All the issues will be treated {^_Â°}.
